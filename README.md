# DESCRIPTION

This is a ruby on rails API that I built following the tutorial "Pagination in Ember with a JSON API Backend" by Frank Treacy (https://emberigniter.com/pagination-in-ember-with-json-api-backend/) .

This is a Rails 6 example with Kaminari (https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari).

# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version 2.7
- Rails 6.0
